						<p>In this short note I'll try to explain what Machine Learning is and what are its the most important types.</p>
						
						<h2 id="what-machine-learning">What is machine learning?</h2>
						
						<p><em>Machine Learning</em> is a term widely used when referred to a process of writing programs which are
						able to ‘learn’ their parameters from given data. We would like the program to “learn” those
						parameters in order to be able to predict certain values for data that we have not observed
						before. For example, we do it to predict future sales of a new phones in order to provide enough of
						them to a store. Or recommend a new book that could be interesting for a client of an on-line
						store. Or detect a disease of a patient.</p>
						<p>In classical science we are observing reality and we are trying to find rules or formulas that model
						it. For example, you may try to observe an object that moves with constant speed. By comparing
						different distances <script type="math/tex">S</script> and times <script type="math/tex">t</script> you should get to a conclusion that</p>
						
						<center><p><script type="math/tex">S = C \cdot t</script>,</p></center>
						
						<p>where <script type="math/tex">C</script> is some constant (which is of course the speed). This formula allows you to tell how much
						time it takes for an object to move on distances that you have not seen before.</p>
						
						<p>In machine learning we do something similar. We start with a formula, often with many unknown
						parameters. Then we fit those parameters to given data and then on new data we test how well we have
						done it. This process is called training. The main difference with classical science is that we do
						not care that much about how the formula looks like as long it produced results that are good
						enough. Very often we are able to accept that the results are far from being perfect as with this
						formula our main goals are getting closer. For example, as long our book recommendation increases
						sales, we do not need to worry if they are not very accurate. In fact, it could happen that some
						less accurate recommendations could produce better sales in a long term.</p>
						<h2 id="types-of-machine-learning">Types of Machine Learning</h2>

						<p>In general distinguish three types of Machine Learning algorithms:</p>
						<ol>
						<li>Supervised learning algorithms: those are used when we use labeled data to build models.</li>
						<li>Unsupervised learning algorithms: those are used when we want to find a new features in data that
						we are not aware of like, for examples, clusters.</li>
						<li>Reinforcement learning algorithms: those are agent that take action in an environment. Their
						objective is to maximize rewards. Classical example is an agent playing a game with a human.</li>
						</ol>

						<h3 id="supervised-learning">Supervised learning</h3>

						<p>The most popular type of Machine Learning is <em>supervised learning</em>. <strong>Supervise</strong> means that the
						process of the training of the model is supervised by providing correct answer. This way the
						algorithm responsible for the training knows if it is doing right or wrong and can adjust
						accordingly parameters of the model. Shortly, this means that we have data the are labeled. They
						should have the format $(X_i, y_i)$ where $X_i$ are the data that are used to predict (often called
						<strong>features</strong>) and $y_i$ are data we want to predict (often called <strong>labels</strong>).</p>

						<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

						<p>we would like to predict what is the temperature tomorrow based on today’s temperature
						and pressure. We have two <em>features</em>: temperature and pressure on specific day and the label is the
						temperature of the next day.</p>

						<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

						<p>we would like to predict if a person is a women or a man based on her/his weight, height and
						age. Here we have three features: weight, height and age, and the label is either: <code class="highlighter-rouge">woman</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">man</code>.</p>

						<p>There is a fundamental difference between <em>Example 1</em> and <em>Example 2</em>. The first on is an example of
						a problem called <strong>regression</strong> and the second is often called <strong>clasification</strong>.</p>

						<h4 id="regressions">Regressions</h4>

						<p>When in supervised learning we deal with labels that are continuous we call such a problem
						<strong>regression</strong>. There are many examples of regressions. The most classical one is the prediction of
						the height of a men based on the height of his father.</p>

						<h4 id="clasification">Clasification</h4>

						<p>In supervised learning we deal with classification problem when labels are discrete. For example, we
						can predict if a picture contains a person or not. Or we could predict if a picture contains object
						of one of the following class: <code class="highlighter-rouge">car</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">plane</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">train</code> or  <code class="highlighter-rouge">motorbike</code>.</p>

						<h3 id="unsupervised-learning">Unsupervised learning</h3>

						<p>In unsupervised we deal we a problem when we do not have labels. So what we actually want to do? We
						could for example build an algorithm that try to cluster data in several classes. Or reduce the
						dimension of data in situation when $X_i$ has lots of features.</p>

						<h3 id="reinforcement-learning">Reinforcement learning</h3>

						<p>Reinforcement learning is algorithm of a different type. Its objective is to train a model (here
						often called an agent) that will decide what action should be taken based on observations of an
						environment (called the <strong>state</strong> of the <strong>environment</strong>). Each action leads to new observation that
						leads to another actions. This algorithm trains the model based on received rewards.</p>

						<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>

						<p><strong>AlphaGo</strong> is an algorithm that has trained an agent that won four out of five games against Lee
						Sedol, one of the best world Go player. Here the <strong>environment</strong> is the Go board. Position of the
						pieces on the board is the <strong>state</strong>. The objective of one of a reinforcement algorithm used to
						train the model was to win as many games as possible (the <strong>reward</strong> is 1 if the agent win the game
						and -1 if lose).</p>

						<p><strong>Next</strong> In the second part we will explain what Linear Regression is, how to train this kind of
						model and then test its performance.
